TAIPEI, TAIWAN (August 19, 2019) Acer’s “Predator” gaming brand has won the 2019 Red Dot Brand Award, becoming the world’s first gaming brand to win this award, which evaluated 8,697 entries from 54 countries. In addition, Acer received the 2019 Red Dot Award for Product Design for the Swift 7 and Swift 5 notebooks, Acer Chromebook 715, Acer Chromebook 11, aiSage edge computing device, and the Predator XB3 series gaming monitors. The latest award wins highlight the global recognition for Acer’s branding and product innovation.

“With our long-term mission of breaking the barriers between people and technology, Acer has always believed in creating brands that stand for the value and quality customers can expect, and thereby bringing brands and people closer,” said Tiffany Huang, Co-COO of Acer Inc. “Predator’s award win injects new inspiration for Acer to create more exciting experiences through its brands. Acer firmly believes that a brand must represent its commitment to consumers, and will continue to integrate Predator’s fearless spirit into daily life, bringing new excitement to gamers around the world.”

“Winning over the Red Dot Jury is no easy task. Our experts are very critical and inspect all of the entries very closely based on strict criteria before reaching a decision regarding a distinction,” explained Professor Dr. Peter Zec, founder and CEO of the Red Dot Award.

Predator Wins the Red Dot Brand Award

The Red Dot Brand Award judges on the entries on the vision and value brands desire to bring, how these are communicated through effective marketing strategies, and their differentiation from competition.  The “Predator” brand calls on gamers to “Summon Your Strength” and to conquer new worlds. To support this brand spirit, Acer has developed a comprehensive portfolio of gaming PCs, displays and accessories, hosted and participated in esports tournaments. In addition, Acer has collaborated with schools and the government in setting up gaming centers for gamers to train or practice their skills.

Acer Swift 7 Thin and Light Notebook

The redesigned Swift 7 is an incredibly thin and light 14-inch notebook, measuring under 1 cm thin at 9.95 mm (0.39 inches) and weighing less than 1 kg at just 890 grams (1.96 pounds). It’s made with magnesium-lithium and magnesium-aluminum alloys, materials that are two to four times stronger than standard aluminum alloys at the same thickness, yet are up to 20 to 35% lighter to keep the laptop under 1 kg. In addition, Acer applied a micro-arc oxidation finish to create a surface with an elegant, ceramic-like material.

Acer Swift 5 Thin and Light Notebook

The Acer Swift 5 (SF515-51T) debuted as the world’s lightest notebook PC with a 15.6-inch display. Designed for discerning customers who want an envy-inducing PC, the Swift 5 delivers exceptional performance in an elegant chassis that weighs less than one kilogram (990 g/2.2 pounds). Providing up to 10 hours of battery life for day-to-night productivity, and running Windows 10, the Swift 5 is a large-screen productivity powerhouse. Its Full HD 1920x1080 IPS[1] touchscreen features ultra-narrow bezels measuring just 5.87 mm (0.23 inches), giving it an incredible 87.6% screen-to-body ratio to create an immersive viewing experience. The wide viewing angles make it easy to enjoy streaming video with friends and colleagues.

Acer Chromebook 715

The Acer Chromebook 715 is the first Acer Chromebook on the market to include a dedicated numeric keypad. The large display provides ample room for the keypad, which gives cloud workers in retail, finance, and service fields — as well as in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) — an efficient way to input data. In addition, the Acer Chromebook 715 has a backlit keyboard so productivity can continue in low-light conditions. The 15.6-inch IPS[1] display allows viewing of multiple apps and tabs in vibrant Full HD 1920x1080 resolution. The Chromebook 715 comes in both touch-screen and standard display options.

Acer Chromebook 11

Designed for the education market, the rugged and durable Acer Chromebook 11 can handle most bumps and spills and includes optional 4G LTE[2] for connectivity and access to data on-the-go. The reinforced case and hinges make it more resistant to twisting and stress, even if students cram them into their backpacks. In addition, the corner-shield structure and rubber bumper keyboard help protect the Chromebook so it can tolerate drops from heights up to 48 inches (122 cm). These features ensure the Chromebook will be protected whether it takes a tumble while being transported or is accidentally knocked off a desk. The anti-slip pattern on the rear case makes it easy to grip and helps prevent it from slipping out of students’ hands.

aiSage Edge Computing Device

The aiSage offers a powerful live-streaming analytics solution for businesses looking to streamline and improve their operations through real-time business intelligence. It supports Amazon Kinesis Video Streams, a solution that makes it easy to securely stream video from connected devices to Amazon Web Services (AWS) for analytics, machine learning (ML), playback, other processing, and AWS IoT.

Predator XB3 Series Displays

The Predator XB3 series gaming monitor is for gamers looking for an incredible gaming experience. It brings games to life in 4K ultra-high definition (3840x2160) immersion and features a rapid 144Hz refresh rate that provides wonderfully smooth images and tear-free gameplay when fast-moving objects buzz across the screen. NVIDIA® G-SYNC™ eliminates screen tearing by adapting to the framerate of the outputting device, resulting in buttery smooth gameplay that offers an unparalleled gaming experience. The IPS[1] display panel features a wide color gamut of 90% of the DCI-P3 color space for vibrant colors that pop out and deeper blacks. For enhanced color vibrancy, VESA DisplayHDR™ 400 certification ensures better contrast and color accuracy so customers experience AAA games as they were meant to be.

In total, the Red Dot Award for Product Design 2019 received more than 5,500 entries from 55 countries.</p>
